# ML_to_identify_POI
In this project we use machine learning to identify the persons of interest i.e, the individuals responsible, directly or indirectly, for the fraud at Enron. 
These deductions are drawn on the basis of email and financial data made public by the authorities. In this project we aim to get a high degree of accuracy with atleast 30% precision and recall values.
